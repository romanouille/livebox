<b>VPN:</b><br>
<br>
The VPN feature enables you to create an extension of your local area network. This service enables two sites to be connected securely over a public network such as the Internet.<br>
When a VPN is active, a secure channel known as a tunnel is created between the two sites. The data transmitted is encrypted as it enters the tunnel and decoded at the other end by the recipient.<br>
The Boxer can create VPN links between two Boxers (easy mode), between a Boxer and another type of VPN server (expert mode) or between a Boxer and a roving user (server mode).<br>
In total, the Boxer can establish four simultaneous VPN connections.<br>
